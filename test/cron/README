README info for setting up and running the nightly build/test for SUNDIALS

Initial setup (will overwrite files if they already exist):
  Export the contents of the SUNDIALS devtest directory from the most recent 
  commit to the git repo into the local devtest directory:
  > cd /usr/casc/sundials/devtest
  > git archive --remote=ssh://git@mystash.llnl.gov:7999/sundials/sunrepo.git HEAD:devtest | tar -x
  
  The previous commands should create a copy the bin directory from devtest 
  in the git repo in the local devtest directory.

  Change group ownership of bin and its contents to nsde:
  > cd ..
  > chgrp -R nsde devtest
  
  Set group id to enable inheritance of group ownership:
  > chmod -R g+s devtest
  
  Make sunbuild.py and sunset.sh are executable:
  > chmod +x devtest/bin/sunbuild.py
  > chmod +x devtest/bin/sunset.sh
  
  The sunbuild.py script - will attempt to clone, build, and test the most recent 
  commit to the sundials development branch in the git repo.
  
To run the build manually:
  > source /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunset.sh
  > /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunbuild.py

To run script automatically every night from cron:
  Edit your personal crontab:
  > crontab -e
  
  Add an entry to run the sunbuild.py script (example runs at 2:15 AM every day)
  15 2 * * * . /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunset.sh; /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunbuild.py
 
NOTES:
  The 'nightly' directory on same level as bin, is required to exist by the script.
  This directory will have all the clones and builds of the git repo.
